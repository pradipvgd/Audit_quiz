case: `MINSAN Ltd., an unlisted company in South India, is engaged in the business of spice oil extraction. Total paid up capital of the company is 9 crore. The company is using conventional methods for extraction of oil from spices. This requires more human intervention and hence, the cost of production is high as compared to innovative method used by other new companies. Though the company had significant growth in the past years, it has not done well over the last two financial years due to competition. A new competitor viz, Natural Extracts Ltd, had come in the market during the year 2022 and by the end of March, 2023, they captured around 75% of market share by offering the product at a reduced price. In order to reduce cost of production and thereby re-capture the market, the management of MINSAN Ltd. has planned to erect a new plant with an automatic machine. The company approached SA Bank Ltd. for a term loan of 80 lakh. During the audit for the year 2023-24, the audit team submitted findings including a lawsuit by a material supplier (PX Ltd.) for ₹3 crore, a show cause notice from the State Pollution Control Board, and three instances of fraud by employees totaling ₹1.02 crore.`,
                topic: "Going Concern (SA 570)",
                question: "As per SA 570, which of the following audit procedures should NOT be performed to assess whether MINSAN Ltd is a going concern or not?",
                options: { a: "Analysis and discussion with the management of the company to find out whether installation of new plant and machinery would enable the company to reduce the cost of production.", b: "Inquire the company's legal counsel regarding existence of legal litigation and claim against the company, reasonableness of management assessments of their outcome and estimate of their financial implication.", c: "Evaluating management's future plan and strategy to increase the market share of the product.", d: "Analysis and discuss the company's cash flow and profit of the previous years with the projected accounts." },
                answer: "d",
                reason: "As per SA 570, analyzing and discussing the company's past cash flow and profit with projected accounts is not a primary procedure for assessing the going concern assumption. The other options are relevant procedures."

                answer: "a",
                reason: "As per SA 540, 'Judgments about the outcome of pending litigation' is an example of an accounting estimate that may have high estimation uncertainty. This uncertainty stems from several factors inherent in the legal process."

                answer: "d",
                reason: "As per SA 706, if the auditor considers it necessary to draw users' attention to a matter presented in the financial statement and the auditor would not be required to modify the opinion, he gives Emphasis of Matter paragraph with a clear reference to the matter being emphasized and to where relevant disclosures that fully describe the matter can be found in the financial statement."

As the audit team of the company became aware of information concerning an instance of non-compliance with law, what would not be the audit procedure to be performed?",

                answer: "c",
                reason: "Monitoring legal requirements and ensuring operating procedures are designed to prevent non-compliance is a responsibility of management, not a specific audit procedure performed by the auditor upon discovery of non-compliance as per SA 250."

Also qualify the report as there are misstatements that are material but not pervasive." },
                answer: "c",
                reason: "As per clause (ix) of Para 3 of CARO, 2020, the auditor is required to report that whether term loans were applied for the purpose for which the loans were obtained. Since the machinery acquired is an improved version for the same purpose, it is considered applied for the purpose it was sanctioned."
